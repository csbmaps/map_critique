## 2\. Presentation and peer review

Academics often attend conferences where they share their discoveries and browse the work of others to gain new ideas and offer feedback. on **March 14th**, we will hold a final presentation meeting at the digital earth lab. Each student is expected to present their final project in ~8 minutes. And there will be a F&Q session in 2 ~ 3 minutes.  During the final presentation, each student will need to review all final projects and submit your review notes.

## 3\. Submission

Please submit the url link of your final project's github repository to the final project submission tab on Canvas. **(by 5:00pm on March 19th)**.


>  **Note:** The requirements to the final project may be slightly changed according the progress of this course. The final requirements are subject to the instructor's notification.
